Physics is the foundation of our understanding of the universe—it
explains how everything from the tiniest particles to the vast galaxies behave and interact.
By studying physics, we unlock the principles behind motion, energy, light, sound, electricity, and gravity,
which in turn power the technologies we use every day—from smartphones and medical imaging to space travel and renewable energy.
More than just equations and experiments, physics trains the mind to think critically, solve complex problems,
and appreciate the elegant laws that govern nature. Whether you're designing a rocket or simply boiling water,
physics is quietly shaping the world around you.
